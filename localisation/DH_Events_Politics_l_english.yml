 DH_politics_australia.2.t:0 "Prime Minister Arthur Fadden resigns"
 DH_politics_australia.2.d:0 "In a Stunning turn of events today the coalition government of the UAP propped up by independents has collapsed. Arthur Fadden proved unable to quell the fears of his backbenchers and independent MP’s in both his government’s policies and their ability to pursue the defence of the Pacific and the Australian Soldiers thrown into meatgrinders abroad. A Labour Government has now been formed and sworn in under Prime Minister John Curtin."

 DH_politics_australia.3.d:0 "Prime Minister John Curtin has passed away this morning at the age of 60, the toll of constant travelling to both London and Washington mixed with his pre-existing Heart Disease has proven to be a fatal combination. A Catholic Priest was called to give last rites but Curtin refused to see him having not stepped foot in a Catholic Church for all of his adult life not even for a friends wedding. He leaves behind a lasting legacy ranging from his widespread tax reform and significant expansions of the Australian Social Service systems. Among the many tributes paid to him General Macarthurs stands out the most ‘the preservation of Australia from invasion will be his immemorial monument’. For now his deputy Frank Forde has taken over as Prime Minister."
 DH_politics_australia.3.A:0 "May his soul rest in peace."

 DH_politics_australia.4.t:0 "The Liberal Party of Australia is founded"

Founded in 1945 to replace the United Australia Party (UAP), the broadly centre-right Liberal Party is one of the two major parties in Australian politics, along with the Australian Labor Party (ALP)."
