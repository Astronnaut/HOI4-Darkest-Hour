 DH_poland.1.t:0 "German-Polish Alliance"
 DH_poland.1.d:0 "The German Führer has reiterated once more that an alliance between Germany and Poland is beneficial to both. It would create a strong coalition against the Soviets in the east, making another invasion from the east unlikely. On the other hand, going with Germany will bring us on a collision course with the Western Powers of France and Britain."
 DH_poland.1.a:0 "Join, for a united Eire"
 DH_poland.1.b:0 "Thank them for the offer"
