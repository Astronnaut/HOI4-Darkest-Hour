 DH_flavor_ENG.1.d:0 "Sailors from HMCS Saguenay stood guard as His Majesty King Edward VIII formally opened the Canadian National Vimy Memorial; described by the King himself as “an inspired expression in stone, chiseled by a skillful Canadian hand, of Canada's salute to her fallen sons.” 50,000 pilgrims, including President Albert Lebrun of France, attended the unveiling of the grand monument. Built-in solemn remembrance of the Canadian Corps’ assault on Vimy Ridge in 1917 –where for the first time men from all provinces of the nation fought side by side– the towering limestone monument stands as a testament to Canadian heroism and national unity."
