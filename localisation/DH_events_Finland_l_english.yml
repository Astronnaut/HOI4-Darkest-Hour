 DH_finland.1.t:0 "Northern Flank: Finland"
 DH_finland.1.d:0 "German diplomats have approached us with the offer to take over rightfull Finnish territory. Karelia, the Kola peninsula and Olonetsk are offered for our unconditional membership to the Axis faction. Their reason for abondoning the lands seems to evolve around the harsh winter conditions. Ah well, their problem. If we accept we are expected to function as Germany's northern flank, safeguarding the north of their new possessions in the east."
 DH_finland.1.a:0 "We Gladly Accept"
 DH_finland.1.b:0 "We don't need Germany's help"
