 DH_Germany_Isabella.1.t:0 "Operation Isabella"
 DH_Germany_Isabella.1.d:0 "Germany has long sought to secure bases of operation in the Atlantic. A thorough study has found the Portuguese islands of the Azores and those of the Cape Verde to be the prime targets of such a geo-political move. However, the Portuguese are closely tied to their historical allies in Britain. Demanding too much might backfire..."

 DH_Germany_Isabella.2.t:0 "Telegram from Lisbon, they accept!"
 DH_Germany_Isabella.2.d:0 "Our demands have been approved by Lisbon and a handover of the Cape Verde will be arranged. Portugal has proven to be willing, but only time will determine their future destiny within the New Order of Europe."
 DH_Germany_Isabella.2.A:0 "Excellent!"

 DH_Germany_Isabella.3.t:0 "Telegram from Lisbon, they reject!"
 DH_Germany_Isabella.3.d:0 "German attempts to attain foreward naval bases in the Atlantic have been met with stiff resistance from the Portuguese government, leaving us no option but to explore alternative ways to gain a hold on the shipping lanes to and from Europe. Perhaps Franco's Spain can be enticed to launch a frontal assault on Portugal..."

 DH_Germany_Isabella.6.t:0 "Spain refuses war with Portugal"
 DH_Germany_Isabella.6.d:0 "Our offer to help Spain conquer Portugal has been met with refusal from Madrid. This proves once more that Franco's aim is to sit out the war until it's won, thereby infuriating the Führer. Ah well, Spain does not seem so keen on uniting the Iberian peninsula after all."

 DH_Germany_Turkey.1.d:0 "Historically the lands of Georgia and Armenia have been under Ottoman influence, and being south of the Caucasus mountains, it would be wise to hand over these regions to Turkey to limit our administrative burden. On the other hand, it could bolster Turkish ambitions and lead to unfounded future expectations."

 DH_Germany_Soviet.2.t:0 "Commercial Agreement Cancelled"
 DH_Germany_Soviet.2.d:0 "Time has come to cancel our agreement with the Soviets regarding the trade of our commercial goods for their raw materials. The treaty was disadvantageous to Germany in the long run anyway."

 DH_Germany_Soviet.3.t:0 "Crusade Against the West"
 DH_Germany_Soviet.3.d:0 "By joining forces the Fascist and Comintern can destroy the West for once and for all. For this however, the Soviet will first have to be convinced.

 DH_Germany_Soviet.4.t:0 "The Soviets Accept"
 DH_Germany_Soviet.4.d:0 "Our new friends in the Kremlin have gratefully accepted the offer to launch a combined attack on the Western Powers. Sharing the same enemies creates a bond after all..."

 DH_Germany_Cyprus.1.t:0 "The Cyprus Question"
 DH_Germany_Cyprus.1.d:0 "The British naval base in the eastern Mediterranean has now fallen in German hands, and since Cyprus is home to a considereable population of Turks, it has sparked Ankara's interest in what has been called the Question of Cyprus. Turkish claims on the island are strong, but the Italians have styled themselves as the masters of the Mediterranean. Other than that it can always serve as a base for the Kriegsmarine."

 DH_Germany_Heims_in_Reich.2.d:0 "Eastern Silesia was lost to Poland after the First World War, even though the plebiscite showed that a majority voted to remain with Germany. This lost region is once again incorporated into Upper Silesia, adding also the Olsagebiet, a historical part of Silesia proper.

 DH_Germany_Heims_in_Reich.3.d:0 "When the Memelland was forcefully annexed by Lithuania it was destined to return under Prussian administration, which will undo the Lithuanisation of the region in the past decades.

 DH_Germany_Anschluss.1.d:0 "Ever since Austria lost its Empire it has been seeking a new destiny. Many turned to Germany for guidance, and after witnessing the progress made by National-Socialism it increased the desire of the Austrians to merge with their bretheren in the west. However, not everybody in Austria thinks the same and some of Germany's leadership advise a cautious approach to the Austrian Question."

 DH_Germany_Anschluss.2.d:0 "Attempts of unification have been turned down by Vienna. Politicians have argued that it is against the stipulations of the Saint-Germain treaty and breaching international law would only anger neighbouring countries. Berlin on the other hand, is determined to unite Austria with Germany. Another Brother's war looms on the horizon..."
 DH_Germany_Anschluss.2.A:0 "Eisen und Blut!"
 
 DH_Germany_Anschluss.3.t:0 "Ostmarkanschluss"
 DH_Germany_Anschluss.3.d:0 "Calls for unification can no longer be ignored; in the past few months people have become uneasy with the current status of Austria as a mere puppet of Germany. By reorganising the Ostmark in several Reichsgau it can easily be absorbed by Germany."

 DH_Germany_France.2.t:0 "The French Question"
 DH_Germany_France.2.d:0 "By establishing a buffer state on the Reich's western border and thereby pushing France back, the question of France has come to the fore. Some argue it is best to continue military occupation for the time being, and perhaps for the unforeseeable future. Others are in favour of re-establishing France under the Vichy regime by granting it territorial concessions. Ideologically speaking, others argue, the region must be put under a puppet regime for economical, cultural and geopolitical reasons."

 DH_germany.7.t:0 "Tyrol remains divided"
 DH_germany.7.d:0 "The Italians have reiterated that South Tyrol remains an Italian province, thereby maintaining the status quo established since the aftermath of the First World War. It is clear that Tyrol will never be united, and the Volksdeutsche in the region will have to be resettled in the Empire, with possible locations in the Crimea or in Franche Comté."
 
 DH_germany.8.t:0 "Tyrol has been united"
 DH_germany.8.d:0 "Since South Tyrol is predominantly German it belongs in the Empire, united with their fellow brethren in Innsbruck. This finally settles any conflicts Germany has in the region.

 DH_germany.35.t:0 "Fate of the British Empire"
 DH_germany.35.d:0 "Albion has fallen, and the breakup of the British Empire is almost a reality. Through the centuries the Anglo-Saxons have built up an impressive Imperium, spanning to all four corners of the globe. Preserving it would most likely turn the British into a valuable ally, still ruling the waves."

The youth have been seen taking over elements of the language and culture shown, but above all the idoleological undercurrents omnipresent in the cinematography are doing their intented purpose. Cultural ministers are posing the question whether Babelsberg films should be restricted and some of them even prohibited from being shown. Such a move would damage our relations however..."
