 DH_austria.4.d:0 "The 1920s were a turbulent period for Austria. The clashes between left and right-wing forces became increasingly violent and eventually escalated into open revolt in July 1927. In 1932 Engelbert Dollfuss was elected chancellor and under his leadership Austria became increasingly centralized and the country began to move more and more towards fascism."
