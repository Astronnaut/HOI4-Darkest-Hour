 DH_soviet.1.t:0 "German-Soviet Commercial Agreement"
 DH_soviet.1.d:0 "It seems that the Germans have need of raw material from Mother Russia. In return for the supply of oil and chromium we are to be granted letters of credit, with which we can buy consumer goods. This will relieve our population's needs for everyday goods, thus strengthening our legitimacy. On the flipside, it will also improve Germany's capacity to produce war material."

 DH_soviet.5.t:0 "Proposition from Berlin"
 DH_soviet.5.d:0 "It seems that Berlin has finally come around, and acknowledges our shared duty in spreading the world revolution to all four corners. Combined, Germany and the Soviet Union shall embark on a crusade against the west. It merely requries our pledge of allegiance."
